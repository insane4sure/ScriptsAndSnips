# About Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** is a modern IT practice that involves managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, rather than manual hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. IaC enables teams to automate, standardize, and version-control their infrastructure, leading to improved consistency, faster deployments, and reduced risk of human error.

## Key Benefits of IaC
- **Automation:** Streamlines infrastructure provisioning and management.
- **Consistency:** Reduces configuration drift and ensures environments are reproducible.
- **Version Control:** Infrastructure changes are tracked and auditable, just like application code.
- **Scalability:** Makes it easier to scale resources up or down as needed.
